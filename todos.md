# TODOs

- [ ] Update frontend flows to capture/select `school_id` during room creation, assignment management, and dashboard filtering so the new multi-school schema is exercised end-to-end.
- [ ] Sync Supabase auth emails into `profiles.email` automatically (trigger or backend job) so admin tooling can safely filter by email.
