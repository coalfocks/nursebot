**Prompt for Evaluation of Medical Student Responses to Text-Based Pages**
When evaluating medical student performance in responding to clinical pages or text messages,
please use the following detailed scale (1 to 5). This evaluation is specifically designed
considering the student's preparation level as a fourth-year medical student transitioning toward
internship. As active listening responses are limited due to the text-based format, they emphasize
concise yet complete clinical decision-making, focused questioning, clarity of medical
explanations, diagnostic reasoning, patient care planning, appropriate demonstration of medical
knowledge, professional tone, timeliness of follow-up, and overall practical communication
suitable for short interactions via paging systems.
---
**Scoring Criteria**
Each student response should be evaluated in detail across three key domains:
### 1. Clinical Reasoning
Assess the student's ability to think critically through clinical scenarios, use relevant medical
knowledge, demonstrate sound diagnostic approaches, and propose appropriate next steps in
patient management.
- **Score 1 (Poor):**
- Limited clinical judgment, inappropriate or incomplete assessments.
- Neglects key patient information or significant clinical details.
- No clear diagnostic strategy, or incorrect/inappropriate proposed management.
- **Score 2 (Below Average):**
- Minimal clinical reasoning skills shown with partial relevance.
- Makes superficial assessments, overlooks critical aspects of patient's clinical presentation or
data.
- Inadequate clinical reasoning leads to very limited or vague management plans.
- **Score 3 (Average):**
- Demonstrates reasonable, standard clinical reasoning for their level.
- Appropriately identifies main clinical concerns but misses some subtleties.
- Provides acceptable but generic management plans, missing nuance or depth.
- **Score 4 (Very Good):**
- Consistently shows sound clinical reasoning aligned with level of intern.
- Clearly identifies key clinical issues, effectively prioritizes them, and proposes thoughtful next
steps in diagnosis or management.
- Demonstrates evidence-based thinking and appropriate use of medical knowledge.
- **Score 5 (Excellent):**
- Outstanding clinical reasoning reflective of early intern-level competence and decision making.
- Quickly identifies critical clinical issues, relevant differential diagnoses, and articulates concise
and effective management proposals along with well-considered follow-up steps.
- Demonstrates advanced reasoning beyond typical student expectations, utilizing comprehensive
medical knowledge actively in responses.
### 2. Communication Skills
Assess the students' clarity, conciseness, ability to explain clinical reasoning and medical
concepts without confusion or ambiguity, and their capability in asking targeted and relevant
follow-up questions through short messaging.
- **Score 1 (Poor):**
- Unclear, confusing responses with frequent inaccuracies.
- Ineffective questioning or follow-up communication; no relevant clarification or details
provided.
- Communication completely unsuitable for paging or messaging format.
- **Score 2 (Below Average):**
- Responses show limited clarity; occasional confusion for the recipient.
- Questions are minimal or inappropriate, lacking direction or relevance.
- Responses not well-adapted to short, concise paging interactions.
- **Score 3 (Average):**
- Generally clear communication, but may include unnecessary information or lacks proper
conciseness.
- Adequately relevant follow-up questions, but occasionally missing important points.
- Adequate for pages, but room remains for improved efficiency and clarity.
- **Score 4 (Very Good):**
- Clear and appropriate communication, generally concise and efficient.
- Effectively asks meaningful questions specific to clinical context, facilitating diagnostic and
management clarity.
- Responses typically clear, medically accurate, and adapted well for short messaging
interactions.
- **Score 5 (Excellent):**
- Superior communication quality: consistently clear, succinct, and precise.
- Exceptional skill in formulating questions and follow-up communications, directly relevant to
clinical scenario.
- Ideals for paging: responses are highly effective, precise, and demonstrate a mature
understanding of clinical and practical information exchange.
### Overall Performance Scoring (1–5)
Assign an overall numerical score based on collective evaluation from above criteria, reflecting
an integrated assessment of the student's readiness approaching internship level.
---
### Feedback Guidelines
Provide detailed evaluation structured in JSON format clearly, including each of these required
components for each area (Clinical Reasoning, Communication Skills):
- Numeric Score
- Detailed Comments (at least 2–3 sentences)
- At least 2–3 Key Strengths
- At least 2–3 Areas for Improvement

Additionally, include:
- **Short summary** explicitly stating student's overall performance.
- **Specific Recommendations** for areas requiring further improvement targeted toward intern
preparedness.
---

Context of the interaction (the first message is from the nurse to the doctor):
${context}

Provide your evaluation in a structured JSON format matching this TypeScript interface:

interface FeedbackResponse {
  summary: string;
  overall_score: number;
  clinical_reasoning: {
    score: number;
    comments: string;
    strengths: string[];
    areas_for_improvement: string[];
  };
  communication_skills: {
    score: number;
    comments: string;
    strengths: string[];
    areas_for_improvement: string[];
  };
  recommendations: string[];
}

IMPORTANT: You MUST provide detailed feedback for BOTH areas (Clinical Reasoning and Communication Skills). Do not focus on just one area.

**Final Note:**
Keep in mind the audience and context – these are fourth-year medical students at the cusp of
becoming residents/interns. Feedback should be constructive, simple, specific, actionable, direct,
and aimed at identifying priority areas for focused growth to ensure readiness and effectiveness
in their upcoming clinical roles.`
